# NEU 337 - Spring 2020
# Programing and Data Analysis for Modern Neuroscience


## Course Objective

*The ability to read and write are obvious fundamental skills critical to all academic and quantitative pursuits.* **Fast approaching this level of fundamental importance is the ability to write computer programs to analyze and manipulate data sets ever increasing in richness and size.** This skillset is necessary to work with a wide array of systems whose models and behavior are sufficienlty complex to make analysis by hand intractable. *These approaches are highly salient not only for neuroscience, but have wide applicability to data analysis in general.*

**In this course you will translate problems into code applying modern approaches for data analysis, statistical inference and modeling to various levels of neural systems and their component behavior.** We will use Python as a coding environment, and you will be exposed to resources and options for scientific computing.

## Requirements

There are no absolute requirements for the course, but you are expected to be familiar with basic mathematical functions, i.e. y(x) = 8 x^2 + 3. Prior experience with programming and familiarity with basic matrix multiplication will also be helpful, but are not necessary.

## Syllabus

Please note that the syllabus is subject to change. It is your responsibility to attend class in order to know what is going on.


## Grading


## Install Python (required)
1. Get the Anaconda Python distribution (latest version 3.x) from https://www.anaconda.com/download and just follow the install steps. Anaconda comes with a bunch of useful scientific libraries such as Numpy and Scipy that you would otherwise have to install yourself.
2. Launch Anaconda Navigator. Install JupyterLab and Spyder via the widgets in the Home tab. JupyterLab is a web-based python notebook and Spyder is an environment for running Python that is similar to MATLAB.


## Install R (optional)
1. Get R from https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/index.html and run the installer.
2. Get RStuio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/. This is an environment for running R that is similar to MATLAB.


## Install Julia (optional)
I recommend just following the instructions at https://docs.junolab.org/latest/man/installation/. Get the latest stable release. I also recommend installing the Atom editor and Juno IDE.


## Install MATLAB (optional)
UT students have free access to MATLAB.

1. Go to www.mathworks.com and create a user account. **Your username MUST be your UT email address!**
2. Go to [UT Service Now](https://ut.service-now.com/utss/catalogoverview.do?sysparam_citems_id=f9d65c7c4ff9d200f6897bcd0210c77d&sysparam_cat_id=e0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4,Information%20Technology&sys_click_name=features&sys_features=1) and request MATLAB. **Click the Request button in the MATLAB for Students Only box near the bottom of the page.** Your request may take a day or two to process, so don't delay.
3. Sign in to your mathworks account and you should see a license from UT is available to you. Use that license to download MATLAB (latest version). Then run the installer. If you can afford the space (>20 GB) *get all the toolboxes that you can*. If not, *get at least those toolboxes listed at https://www.mathworks.com/products.html under the MATLAB product family sections 'Math, Statistics, and Optimization', 'Signal Processing', 'Image Processing' and 'Computational Biology'.*

Note, once you've registered you can also use MATLAB via an online interface that mimicks the application environment at https://matlab.mathworks.com.


## Install GitHub Desktop (optional)
1. Go to https://github.com and create an account if you don't already have one.
2. Go to https://desktop.github.com and download the GitHub Desktop app.
3. Open the app and select File->Clone Repository. Select URL and enter the URL of this repository (https://github.com/marcel-goldschen-ohm/NEU337-Spring2020), then click 'Clone'. This will download all of the files in this repository to a folder on your computer. To navigate to the folder from GitHub Desktop select Repository->Show in Finder (that's for MacOS, wording may differ on Windows machines).
4. Whenever you want to make sure that you have the latest version of all files in the repository, select Repository->Pull to download ONLY what has changed since the last time you downloaded the repository.
5. *To make sure you do not overwrite any homework assignment files, I recommend copying all of the homeworks into a separate folder on your computer rather than editing the files directly in the GitHub repository folder.*

## Resources
* [Python Challenges](http://www.pythonchallenge.com): Fun! Will test your Python skills.
* [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com): Quick course on statistics and Python with examples. **This is a good place to start.**
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook): Explanations and examples. **This is also a good first learning tool.**
* [Computational Statistics in Python](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2017): Great collection of references with examples. Highly recommend! **Mostly for reference and code examples, but they're very useful.**
* [Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com): **MUST READ!!!**
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf): Nice intro to fairly complex statistical methods with very little math. Highly recommend! Example code is in R, but explanations are helpful in general. Note that this is a bit longer and more indepth than the options above. **This is more about understanding statistical methods than coding.**
